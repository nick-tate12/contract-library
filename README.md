## How to Run Properly

- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run watch:css`. I believe this needs to be run in the background at all times? not sure why but it follows css changes.
- Run `npm run compile`.
- Run `npm run start-dev` or if that gets stuck, run `npm run start-once` first.

*maybe the `npm run start-dev-ui` is working now, but not sure.
