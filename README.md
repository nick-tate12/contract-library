## How to Run Properly
- Run `npm install`.
- Run `npm run watch:css`. I believe this only need to be ran once. Not 100% sure yet.
- Run `npm run compile`.
- Run `npm run start-dev` or if that gets stuck, run `npm run start-once` first.

*maybe the `npm run start-dev-ui` is working now, but not sure.
